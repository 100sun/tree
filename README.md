# tree

I like the [tree](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree) command. It has nice output, and is generally a good short programming exercise. This repo is a collection of implementations that I've done in different languages.

Below are instructions on how to run them. Note that this doesn't include instructions for how to install the languages themselves.

* elixir - `elixir elixir/tree.exs`
* go - `go run go/tree.go [?path]`
* ruby - `ruby ruby/tree.rb [?path]`
